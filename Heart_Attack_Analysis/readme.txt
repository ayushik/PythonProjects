HeartAttackAnalysis
Introduction
 A heart attack occurs when an artery supplying your heart with blood and oxygen becomes blocked. A blood clot can form and block your arteries, causing a heart attack. This Heart Attack Analysis helps to understand the chance of attack occurrence in persons based on varied health conditions.

Dataset
The dataset is Heart_Attack_Analysis_Data.csv. It has been uploaded to elearn. 
This dataset contains data about some hundreds of patients mentioning Age, Sex, Exercise Include Angina(1=YES, 0=NO), CP_Type (Chest Pain)(Value 1: typical angina, Value2: atypical angina, Value 3: non-anginal pain, Value 4: asymptomatic), ECG Results, Blood Pressure, Cholesterol, Blood Sugar, Family History (Number of persons affected in the family), Maximum Heart Rate, Target -0=LESS CHANCE , 1= MORE CHANCE

Aim 
Building a Predictive Model using Na√Øve Bayesian Approach (Which features decide heart attack?)
Comment on the performance of this model using AUC-ROC, Precision, Recall, F_score, Accuracy

Need to 
a) Preprocess the data to enhance quality
b) Carry out descriptive summarization of data and make observations
c) Identify relevant, irrelevant attributes for building model. 
d) Use data visualization tools and make observations
e) Carry out the chosen analytic task. Show results including intermediate results, as needed
f) Evaluate the solution

HeartAttackAnalysis1

In continuation to the previous problem statement, we are supposed to do the following things for this assignment.
1) Implement predictive models/classifiers using the following classification approaches:
Logistic Regression
Decision tree
Ensemble Methods (any one of your choice)
K-Nearest Neighbour

2) Compare the performances of each model/classifier considering the given dataset using different evaluation measures such as Precision, Recall, F1-Score, AUC-ROC. Show the comparison chart in Python notebook
3) Identify the model which you think is the best amongst all the models you have built. Also, explain why you think this is the best model. Answer this question in the notebook itself.
