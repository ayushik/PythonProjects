                        Comment on the performance of this model using AUC-ROC, Precision, Recall, F_score, Accuracy
                        Implement predictive models/classifiers using the following classification approaches:
                            Logistic Regression
                            Decision tree
                            Ensemble Methods (any one of your choice)
                            K-Nearest Neighbour
                        Compare the performances of each model/classifier considering the given dataset using different evaluation measures such as Precision, Recall, F1-Score, AUC-ROC. Show the comparison chart in Python notebook
                        Identify the model which you think is the best amongst all the models you have built. Also, explain why you think this is the best model.
